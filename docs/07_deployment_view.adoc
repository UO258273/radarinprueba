The user will need his phone connected to the internet, where he can deploy the app.
Our application, Radarin, will be hosted in github pages.
Solid PODs are required for using the application, in our case, we chose the Irupt provider of PODs. The POD is like a server, so can be accewsible anywhere in the world.

.Motivation
The aim of this project is to allow people to locate themselves with their friends with a simply interface, which will be based if having access to user's PODs with the location info.

.Infraestructure
As it is shown in the diagram at the beginning of the section the main parts of the project will be:

*The user's device

*The web server, where the app really runs

*The application itself

*The POD server

*The user's PODs
